## Let's fight for Malaysia's Popcat world ranking ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾

This is a JS auto-click script for <a href="https://popcat.click/" target="_blank">PopCat challenge</a> with anti-spam prevention (bypass bot detection).

The script accesses the PopCat's Vue app instance directly and manipulate the key variables which contributes to click counter, spam counter and API call, so to ensure that:

1. You hit the max 800 clicks per 30s (according to the API rate limit)
2. You won't get marked as bot


## About Popcat Rules

- API rate limit = 800 clicks per 30 seconds (So far I can't bypass this)....
- If you send 800 clicks or above, system will only record 800 clicks & spam score +1
- If you hit 10 spam scores, system will mark you as bot & no further clicks will be sent to API

```diff
- Only allow 1 browser per device. API rate limit is enforced per IP address.
```
